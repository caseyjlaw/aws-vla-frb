## Bringing VLA FRB project to AWS

The SKA and AWS started a program to bring radio astronomy tools and data to the Amazon cloud. The goal is to develop use cases (and customers) for big-data-style problems in the cloud.

We won a grant to store 200 TB of data as a public AWS data set. We also won credit to process that data on AWS. The data is "fast dump" (5 ms) VLA visibilities from a 200 hour survey for FRBs.

This repo will be the home of code and documentation of the process of using AWS for this 200 TB data set. Some code snippets being tested and saved at https://gist.github.com/caseyjlaw.
